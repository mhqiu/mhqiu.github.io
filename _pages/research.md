My broad research interest is to better understand the sustainability challenges we face at the intersection of **air quality**, **energy systems**, and **climate**. In particular, the opportunities and challenges in air quality management and regulations under a changing climate and future energy systems. From a methodology perspective, I use statistical causal inference, machine learning models and chemical transport models to evaluate the effects of adopted policy and actions. **Current projects:** 1) evaluating policy effects on air quality under changing meteorological conditions; 2) machine learning models for modeling air pollution; 3) why and how air quality actions influence different locations differently.
