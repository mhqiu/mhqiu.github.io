Hello! My name is Minghao Qiu (邱明昊). I am a PhD candidate at MIT's [Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu/), pursuing my PhD in [Social & Engineering System](https://idss.mit.edu/academics/ses_doc/) (an interdisciplinary program in data science and social science). I am advised by [Noelle Selin](http://www.selingroup.org/noelle-eckley-selin) and my thesis committee also includes [Valerie Karplus](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/people/faculty/valerie-karplus.html), [Cory Zigler](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/zigler/home) and [Colette Heald](https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/colette-l-heald/). I am a [Martin Family Fellow of Sustainability](https://martin-fellows.mit.edu/) and a recipient of fellowship from the [Young Scientist Summer Program at IIASA](https://iiasa.ac.at/web/home/education/yssp/Young_Scientists_Summer_Program.html). Before coming to MIT, I received bachelor degrees in environmental sciences and economics from Peking University in Beijing. 

My research interest is in environmental and energy policies with a global focus on issues involving air pollution, climate change and energy systems. My research uses causal inference, machine learning, and atmospheric chemistry modeling to study the sustainability challenges at the intersection of energy, pollution and climate using real-world data. My research has spanned the electricity, industrial, and transportation sectors in China, US, and EU. From a methodology perspective, I am interested in developing data-driven approaches with insights from complex atmospheric chemistry models (such as [GEOS-Chem](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/geos/)) and understanding the uncertainty and limitations of econometric and statistical models in such application.
