Hello! My name is Minghao Qiu (邱明昊). I am a [postdoctoral fellow in planetary health](https://globalhealth.stanford.edu/planetary-health/announcing-three-new-postdoctoral-fellows-in-planetary-health.html/) at Stanford's Department of Earth System Science and Center for Innovation in Global Health. At Stanford, I am primamrily advised by [Marshall Burke](https://web.stanford.edu/~mburke/) as a part of the [ECHO (Environmental Change and Human Outcomes) Lab](https://www.stanfordecholab.com/). I am a [Martin Family Fellow of Sustainability](https://martin-fellows.mit.edu/) and a recipient of fellowship from the [Young Scientist Summer Program at IIASA](https://iiasa.ac.at/web/home/education/yssp/Young_Scientists_Summer_Program.html).

I received my PhD degree from MIT's [Institute for Data, Systems, and Society](https://idss.mit.edu/) on September 2021, advised by [Noelle Selin](http://www.selingroup.org/noelle-eckley-selin). I also worked closely with my committee members:  [Valerie Karplus](https://www.cmu.edu/epp/people/faculty/valerie-karplus.html), [Cory Zigler](https://sites.cns.utexas.edu/zigler/home) and [Colette Heald](https://cee.mit.edu/people_individual/colette-l-heald/). I received bachelor degrees in environmental sciences and economics from Peking University in Beijing. 

My broad research interest is in environmental and energy policies with a global focus on issues involving air pollution, climate change, and energy transitions. Specifically, I study the interplay between air pollution and climate change, two critical environmental challenges for humanity in the coming decades. My research uses causal inference, machine learning, atmospheric chemistry modeling, remote sensing to study the sustainability challenges at the intersection of energy, pollution and climate using real-world data. My PhD research has spanned the electricity, industrial, and transportation sectors in China, US, and EU. From a methodology perspective, I am interested in developing data-driven approaches with insights from complex atmospheric chemistry models (such as [GEOS-Chem](http://acmg.seas.harvard.edu/geos/)) and understanding the uncertainty and limitations of econometric and statistical models in such application.
