Hello! My name is Minghao Qiu (邱明昊). I am an Assistant Professor at Stony Brook University, jointly appointed between [School of Marine and Atmospheric Sciences](https://www.stonybrook.edu/somas/people/) and [Program in Public Health](https://publichealth.stonybrookmedicine.edu/faculty/corefaculty). My research studies **air pollution** and **climate change**, their interconnections, their impacts on humans and societies, and how to design effective policies to address these sustainability challenges. 

My group uses observational data, statistical, and atmospheric modeling to study the impacts of air pollution and climate change on humans and society, and policies that could address these challenges. Currently we work on **1)** the impacts of wildfires on air quality and human health in the context of historical and future climate change, **2)** the influences of climate change on air pollutant emissions, atmospheric compositions, and resulting health effects, and **3)** the effects of energy transition and climate policies on pollutant emission, air quality, and human health. 

**I am looking for 1-2 PhD students and 1 postdoctoral fellow to join my group at Stony Brook in Fall 2025. More info at [Opportunity](https://mhqiu.github.io/opportunity/)**

I received my PhD degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology on September 2021, advised by [Noelle Selin](http://www.selingroup.org/noelle-eckley-selin). I was a [Planetary Postdoctoral Fellow](https://globalhealth.stanford.edu/planetary-health-fellowship/how-climate-change-exacerbates-air-pollution-and-its-health-impacts.html/) at Stanford's Doerr School of Sustainability and Center for Innovation in Global Health, primarily working with [Marshall Burke](https://web.stanford.edu/~mburke/). I was a [Martin Family Fellow of Sustainability](https://martin-fellows.mit.edu/) and a recipient of fellowship from the [Young Scientist Summer Program at IIASA](https://iiasa.ac.at/web/home/education/yssp/Young_Scientists_Summer_Program.html). I received bachelor degrees in environmental sciences and economics from Peking University in Beijing.
